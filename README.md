# The movie
it is a project multi platform, run in ios, android, androidtv, ostv and web.
I have used your renative library to support multiplatform.
I have based on redux, redux-saga, cross-fetch, react-native-fast-image, react-native-snap-carousel, react-native-video, react-native.
I have used react-native-debugger to debug and find a bug when enabling Network Inspect.
I have also found another bug in renative, the plugins in version 0.28 cannot be installed with the command line interface, it fails and must be installed manually
I have tried to memorize selectors without using hooks and I have not seen that it was worth it for a test.
